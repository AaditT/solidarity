## Inspiration

The refugee crisis looms over wartorn nations such as Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Despite the difficulties that refugees face in immigrating to America, refugees often face challenging financial burdens in terms of employment. Racist and xenophobic hiring practices hamper refugees' capability of integrating into society. In fact, refugees' high rates of productivity have been empirically proven, making it a win-win situation for all. Inspired by a variety of talks from large corporations, we decided to build a project that would promote inclusion and integration for refugees.


## What it does

Solidarity is a web application that provides a ranking of firms based on online credit scores; these credit scores are determined by the frequency of refugee hiring. Refugees can log in and document their employment history, thus providing data for a firm's credit history. A firm's inclusivity over time is condensed into tables and bar graphs for easy viewing as well.

The most salient feature is the fact that accurate and easily understandable data is hereby made available to the public, enabling them to vote with their dollars for the most inclusive firms.


## How we built it

We built Solidarity using Python3, Flask, Jinja2, ChartJS, HTML5, and CSS3. A Flask server functions as the backend for the site. Jinja2 Templates are used to interface the Python code with the HTML frontend. The website is powered by HTML, CSS, and ChartJS.


## Challenges we ran into

Integrating the Flask server seamlessly into the HTML frontend was not an easy task. We had to demonstrate a fine understanding of HTTP request protocols.  Another challenge was the difficulty of creating a stylized website. The functionality is rock-solid, but the appearance could use a better front-end developer.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our end-to-end integration of the refugee and employer interfaces. The seamless technology binds the two interfaces into a publicaly accessible dashboard. This end-to-end development allows this app to be used by refugees, the public, employers, and activists who would like to vote with their dollars to make the world a better place for those in need.

## What we learned

To begin with, we learned a lot regarding the intricacy and nuances associated with frontend development. In addition, we learned a lot about the ChartJS and Jinja2 technologies with which we created templates and graphed data. We also learned about integrating Flask servers with frontend sites.

## What's next for Solidarity.

The next step for Solidarity. is taking this project to the next level. We hope to work alongside the US Government to utilize refugee authentication procedures and employment data.
